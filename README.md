# Friendlyfeed
Friendlyfeed is supposed to be a somewhat more friendly looking feed for the Discourse homepage. This will provide easy access to categories as well as a feed of newest replied threads and their replies like on various social media. Another goal is to allow easy signup for hidden categories.
